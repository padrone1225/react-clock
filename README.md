# Pomodoro

This project is part of the Free Code Camp's front-end track. I'll build a pomodoro clock using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Functionality

- I can start the 25 min pomodoro.
- I can stop the pomodoro.
- The timer will go off when the 25 min has elapsed.
- I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
- I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

## Technologies used

The client side of the app is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to get it started.

For testing I used [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).
